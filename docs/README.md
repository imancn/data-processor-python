## 🎯 Getting Started

1. **New to the framework?** Start with the [Quick Start Guide](./quick-start.md)
2. **Understanding the architecture?** Read the [System Overview](./architecture/01-system-overview.md)
3. **Building pipelines?** Check the [Pipeline System](./architecture/03-pipeline-system.md)
4. **Deploying to production?** See [Operations & Deployment](./architecture/04-operations-deployment.md)

## 📋 Key Features

- **🎯 Zero Business Logic**: Completely generic - works for any data processing use case
- **🔄 Auto-Discovery**: Just add your pipeline files - framework handles the rest
- **🚀 Production Ready**: Idempotent deployment, process management, health monitoring
- **🧪 Test-Driven**: Comprehensive test suite with coverage reporting and JSON output
- **📊 Observable**: Structured logging, monitoring, and operational insights
- **⚙️ Operational**: Complete toolkit for development, deployment, and maintenance
- **🔧 Extensible**: Plugin architecture for extractors, transformers, and loaders
- **📈 Scalable**: Designed for enterprise data processing workloads
- **🔄 Migration System**: Advanced database migration with rollback capabilities
- **🧹 Clean Architecture**: No hardcoded business logic or domain-specific code
