# System Overview Architecture

## 🏗️ High-Level System Architecture

The Data Processing Framework is designed as a **domain-agnostic, extensible platform** for building robust ETL/ELT data pipelines. The architecture follows clean separation of concerns with pluggable components and automatic service discovery.

## 📊 System Architecture Diagram

> 📊 **Visual Architecture**: See [System Architecture Diagram](../diagrams/system-architecture.puml) for the complete system architecture diagram.

## 🎯 Architectural Principles

### 1. **Clean Architecture**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has distinct responsibilities
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- **Interface Segregation**: Components communicate through well-defined interfaces

### 2. **Plugin Architecture**
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new extractors, transformers, and loaders
- **Modularity**: Components are loosely coupled and highly cohesive
- **Convention over Configuration**: Follow naming patterns for automatic discovery

### 3. **Auto-Discovery Pattern**
- **Zero Configuration**: Just add `*_pipeline.py` files
- **Dynamic Loading**: Framework discovers and registers automatically
- **Runtime Registration**: Pipelines become available without restart

actor "Developer" as Dev
participant "Pipeline Module" as PM
participant "Core Framework" as CF
participant "Pipeline Tools" as PT
participant "Operations" as Ops
participant "External Systems" as Ext

Dev -> PM : Creates pipeline module
PM -> CF : Registers with framework
CF -> PT : Uses tools for processing
PT -> Ext : Extracts data
PT -> Ext : Loads data
CF -> Ops : Manages deployment
Ops -> Ext : Deploys to server

note over Dev, Ext : Complete pipeline lifecycle\nfrom development to production
